## About Me

I'm a fellow and reporter at the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism, and gradute student at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland. I will be graduting in May 2023. Since the beginning of the program, I have developed skills in data analysis and visualization.

I previously worked at local news outlets, like the Staten Island Advance and the Brooklyn Reader, before working for more national outlets like SiriusXM and CNN. For all newsrooms, I wrote stories, produced video and audio pieces, and accompanied these pieces with photos. 

My undergrad degree is from the CUNY College of Staten Island, where I studied Communications: Journalism. Outside of journalism, I enjoy long hikes, discovering new places, and meeting new people. 

Thanks for stopping by!
